### steps to play

1. Check the code because I'm a stranger on the internet and you don't want a virus
2. Download the repo
3. Install Pygame-ce (uninstall normal pygame if installed)
4. cd u3 / u4 ( depending on which game you want to play)
5. bash run.sh

As it turns out the entire u4 game just disappeared from the repo for some reason so that happened.
